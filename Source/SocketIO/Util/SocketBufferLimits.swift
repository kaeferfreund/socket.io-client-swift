/// One resource policy for every queue this client retains data in.
///
/// The JavaScript client has no such policy: `sendBuffer`, `_queue` and its
/// receive path are unbounded, and so are this client's by default. **Every
/// limit here is off unless you set it**, which is what keeps the default
/// behaviour JavaScript-equal. Setting one opts into a hard bound with an
/// explicit, never-silent failure.
///
/// This is the pipeline-wide layer of three:
///
/// * `.parserOptions(SocketParserOptions)` bounds *one* incoming Socket.IO
///   packet (attachment count, text/binary bytes, nesting depth).
/// * `.webSocketOptions(SocketWebSocketOptions)` bounds *one* native WebSocket
///   message and the native send queue.
/// * `.bufferLimits(SocketBufferLimits)` bounds everything that accumulates
///   *across* packets: the application send buffer, the retry queue, the
///   connection-state-recovery replay buffer, the engine-to-manager handoff,
///   one incoming polling HTTP body, and how long a half-reconstructed binary
///   packet may stay outstanding.
///
/// ## Overflow behaviour
///
/// Overflow is never silent and never partial:
///
/// * **Outgoing** (`sendBuffer`, `retryQueue`): the *new* emit fails locally.
///   Its write completion runs once, its acknowledgement settles once with a
///   `SocketBufferLimitError`, the `.error` client event carries the same
///   error, and no packet is buffered, queued or written. Already-accepted
///   emits are never evicted — dropping a reliable emit that the caller
///   believes is queued is exactly the silent data loss this gate forbids.
/// * **Incoming** (replay buffer, handoff backlog, polling body): the
///   connection is closed with `"transport error"`, the reason engine.io-client
///   reports from `_onError` → `_onClose`. A half-reconstructed binary packet
///   that outlives its deadline is a decoder failure and closes with
///   `"parse error"`, the reason `Manager.ondata` reports when the decoder
///   throws. Reconnection then proceeds normally if it is enabled; nothing is
///   replayed from a partial packet.
