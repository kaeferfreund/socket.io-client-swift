---

Send and receive named events, exchange binary payloads, request acknowledgements
and reconnect after interruptions. HTTP long-polling and WebSocket upgrades are
handled by the client; your application works with `SocketManager` and `SocketIOClient`.

**This is a Socket.IO client, not a general-purpose WebSocket library.** It needs a
Socket.IO server. This repository is an independent community fork, not an official
Socket.IO release.

## Why this fork?

This fork exists to address **production problems with the original Swift stack**.
We needed fixes we could maintain, fewer behavioral surprises between our web
and iOS applications, and client features that were missing from the original
implementation.

| Why we continued the project | What changes here |
| --- | --- |
| **[socketio/socket.io-client-swift](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io-client-swift)**<br>Development had stalled while production bugs remained. | Its default branch has not advanced since October 2024. This fork continues development, pairs fixes with regression tests and keeps them in the library rather than in application-specific workarounds. |
| **[daltoniam/Starscream](https://github.com/daltoniam/Starscream)**<br>Another inactive dependency with recurring problems. | Its default branch has not advanced since March 2024. We replaced the Starscream-based transport with Apple's native `URLSessionWebSocketTask`, alongside `URLSession` polling. No third-party Swift dependencies. |
| **Web and native clients need consistent behavior** | Reconnection events, acknowledgement cleanup, buffering and delivery should not unexpectedly change with the client language. Supported behavior is checked against a pinned JavaScript reference, with remaining API and platform differences documented. |
| **Important client features were missing** | Connection state recovery, per-connection dynamic authentication, ordered acknowledgement retries and cancellable async/await acknowledgements are implemented in this fork. |

Maintenance snapshot, checked **2026-09-19**: the latest default-branch commits are
[2024-10-01 for socketio/socket.io-client-swift](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io-client-swift/commit/42da871d9369f290d6ec4930636c40672143905b)
and [2024-03-07 for daltoniam/Starscream](https://github.com/daltoniam/Starscream/commit/c6bfd1af48efcc9a9ad203665db12375ba6b145a).
These are dated observations, not a statement about the maintainers' future plans.

[socketio/socket.io-client-swift](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io-client-swift)
already supports Socket.IO 4 and SPM; those are not the reasons for this fork. See **[the production rationale, concrete behavior differences and
source-linked comparison](Documentation/Guides/WhyThisFork.md)**. Existing applications
should read the [17.x migration guide](Documentation/Guides/Migration.md).

## Requirements

| Component | Minimum / supported range |
| --- | --- |
| Toolchain | Swift 6.4, **Swift 6 language mode**; Xcode 27 for Apple SDKs |
| Platforms | iOS 15, macOS 12, tvOS 15, watchOS 9 |
| Server | Socket.IO 4.x, Engine.IO 4 |
| Transports | HTTP long-polling and WebSocket; no WebTransport |

See [compatibility](Documentation/Guides/Compatibility.md) for protocol boundaries
and [the package manifest](Package.swift) for deployment targets.

## Installation

**Swift Package Manager is the only supported installation method.**

In Xcode, choose **File → Add Package Dependencies**, enter the URL below and select
**Up to Next Major Version** from **17.0.0**. Add the **SocketIO** product to your app target.

```text
https://github.com/kaeferfreund/socket.io-client-swift.git
```

<details>
<summary><strong>Using a Package.swift manifest instead?</strong></summary>

Add the dependency and the product to the appropriate arrays:

```swift
// In Package.dependencies:
.package(
    url: "https://github.com/kaeferfreund/socket.io-client-swift.git",
    from: "17.0.0"
)

// In your target's dependencies:
.product(name: "SocketIO", package: "socket.io-client-swift")
```

</details>

A version requirement installs a **published release**, not the development branch
you are viewing. To evaluate unreleased changes, explicitly select the reviewed
branch or commit in Xcode/SPM. The [17.0.0 release notes](Documentation/Release17.md)
describe the published release.

## Quick start

Keep the manager alive, register listeners before connecting, and use the socket on
its serial `handleQueue`. The default queue is the main queue, so this example keeps
application-side access on `@MainActor`.

<!-- quick-start:begin -->
```swift
import Foundation
import SocketIO

@MainActor
final class RealtimeClient {
    private let manager: SocketManager
    private let socket: SocketIOClient

    init(url: URL) {
        manager = SocketManager(socketURL: url, config: [.log(false)])
        socket = manager.defaultSocket

        socket.on(clientEvent: .connect) { _, _ in
            print("Connected")
        }
        socket.on(clientEvent: .disconnect) { data, _ in
            print("Disconnected:", data)
        }
        socket.on(clientEvent: .connectError) { data, _ in
            print("Connection failed:", data)
        }
        socket.on(clientEvent: .error) { data, _ in
            print("Socket error:", data)
        }
        socket.on("message") { data, _ in
            print("Received:", data)
        }
    }

    func connect() { socket.connect() }
    func disconnect() { socket.disconnect() }
    func send(_ message: String) { socket.emit("message", message) }
}
```
<!-- quick-start:end -->

Retain a `RealtimeClient` in your app, initialize it with your Socket.IO server URL,
and call `connect()` when ready. `autoConnect` is **false** by default.
The wrapper does not change the library's queue-ownership contract or make its objects Sendable.

CI compiles and initializes this example as an independent Swift Package consumer.
The [getting-started guide](Documentation/Guides/GettingStarted.md) expands the walkthrough;
the [acknowledgement guide](Documentation/Guides/Acknowledgements.md) covers callbacks,
async/await, timeouts and retries.

## Validation you can inspect

AI assists implementation review, comparison with the JavaScript client and
regression-test development. Source review and reproducible test results remain
the basis for accepting changes; AI output is not a correctness certificate.

The [Swift workflow](.github/workflows/swift.yml) runs the native regression suite,
checks mapped JavaScript contracts against actual passed tests, and exercises
Thread Sanitizer, strict concurrency, four Apple SDK builds and an independent
SPM consumer. It also checks documentation links and compiles the README example.

The badge above reports **`master`**, not whichever branch or release you are
reading. Check [Actions](https://github.com/kaeferfreund/socket.io-client-swift/actions)
for the exact revision you plan to use. [PARITY.md](PARITY.md) separates supported
behavior from API/platform differences and unsupported features. Passing tests or
high line coverage do **not** establish universal JavaScript parity, and Apple SDK
builds do not replace physical-device runtime validation.

## Important boundaries

Recovery requires a configured Socket.IO 4.6+ server and is not guaranteed. Retries
can deliver an event more than once, so deduplicate non-idempotent operations on the server.
WebTransport, custom JavaScript transport constructors, compression switches and
custom SOCKS routing are not exposed by this native client.
See [PARITY.md](PARITY.md) for the supported scope and explicit exclusions.
