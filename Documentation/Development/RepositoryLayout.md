## Stable paths and preservation

The SPM-only cleanup does not require source or test renames. The manifest,
source, test/fixture files, contract data and existing evidence remain in place.
The split guides retain every substantive section of the former README; only
navigation is replaced with the new index. Old usage pages are retained byte for
byte under `Documentation/Archive/UsageDocs`, not advertised as current guidance.

Already removed plans and completed reports remain reachable through pinned
links in the [archive index](../Archive/README.md). Carthage, CocoaPods and the
retired framework/Xcode project are not restored. Existing license notices are
kept even when they describe historical dependencies rather than the current
package's dependency graph.

## Keep the structure coherent

Add application documentation to `Guides`, implementation/contributor instructions
to `Development`, and a link from the relevant index. Use the detailed migration
pages for compatibility contracts rather than copying competing versions into
new locations. Evidence files must identify their original commit/run and are
not a substitute for a green current CI run.

The offline checker covers current root docs, guides, development pages, indexes,
migration/release pages and the Pages landing page. It deliberately does not
rewrite the historical changelog, chronological review bodies, evidence snapshots
or raw archived pages. It checks local paths and Markdown/HTML anchors, not remote
website availability or the semantic correctness of prose.

Do not add generated API HTML, local IDE state, Node dependencies, build outputs,
credentials or test certificates. `docs/index.html` points to the authored docs;
changing it does not itself deploy a website or merge a branch.
