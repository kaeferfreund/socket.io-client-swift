# Review gate R5: build the library with `-strict-concurrency=complete` and fail
# when the number of concurrency warnings grows.
#
# This is a ratchet, not a clean-build requirement: the fork is not migrated to
# the Swift 6 language mode and the remaining warnings are recorded as a
# baseline instead of being silenced by stamping mutable classes
# `@unchecked Sendable`.
#
# The baseline is per platform, because the Objective-C and Security code paths
# only compile on Apple platforms. A platform with no recorded baseline is
# reported, not failed — the run prints the line to add, so the first CI run on
# a new platform produces the number instead of a red build.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/check-strict-concurrency.sh              # check against the baseline
#   scripts/check-strict-concurrency.sh --record     # rewrite this platform's entry
#
